This is a side project I started recently while thinking about game strategies. The focus here is not the frontend, rather, I'ld like to encourage people to play smart and basically, STRATEGIZE!

## How to play:
1. start by pressing any arrow key
2. avoid bumping into areas that were previously covered

## features coming up:
1. determine maximum number of points
2. multi-player mode
3. ability to choose starting point
