This is a side project I started recently while thinking about game strategies. The focus here is not the frontend, rather, I'ld like to encourage people to play smart and basically, STRATEGIZE!

## How to play:
1. Start by pressing any arrow key
2. Avoid bumping into areas that were previously covered

## Features coming up:
1. Multi-player mode
2. Ability to choose starting point
